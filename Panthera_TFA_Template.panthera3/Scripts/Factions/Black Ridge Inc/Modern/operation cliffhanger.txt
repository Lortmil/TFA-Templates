Operation Cliffhanger  Modlist TFA Standard

The kingdom of Florin is under the terrible rule of Prince Humperdinck. Assisted by
the ruthless Count Rugen they have, together commited many crimes against the
people of Florin, and humanity.

Humperdinck's betrothed, Buttercup, has gone missing from her farm in the Florin 
countryside. Three rogues have been seen in the area where Buttercup appears to 
have been abducted. Humperdinck is obsessed with her and demands her return.

Task Force Athena has been tasked by the Dread Pirate Roberts to rescue Buttercup
and encourage regime change. The last known location of the three kidnappers seems to 
be around the Cliffs of Insanity.

Florin armed forces are known to be operating in the area. A six fingered man, rumoured to
be Rugen, commands from the palace, but has been known to visit the many bases scattered 
throughout Florin.

Be on the lookout for a giant (apparently from Greenland), a Sicilian acedemic, and 
a moustached mercenary.

So begins the first chapter of many.....
